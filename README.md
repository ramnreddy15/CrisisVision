# Autonmous_Portable_Engine

## Description
Search and rescue is crucial during situations such as natural disasters to save lives. An important part of an effective search and rescue operation is the ability quickly and effectively assess a situation and decide how to proceed. However, these natural disasters can present dangers to the search and rescue teams, as the harsh weather conditions and unstable terrain can pose a risk to their safety. We want to create a device that can autonomously collect that the search and rescue team can use the assess the situation without risking their safety.
This autonomous vehicle takes pictures of what it's surroundings and stiches them together to create a panoramic image of the environment. It moves autonomously around the environment, making sure to avoid any obstacles that is in its way. In addition, it will provide a live feed to search and rescue team that will display anything abnormal it finds.
